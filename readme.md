# **Project Paradise - An abandoned AS3 based, Flixel powered rpg game**

**Introduction!**

This abandoned project was started to become a random generated RPG game losely based on the Harvest Moon franchise, but instead of farming it was supposed to be a store that the player could have.
Right now it only is a simplistic random world generator that renders (ugly drawn) tiles with different biomes in a randomly generated world with different islands. It also spawns some villages here and there. Nothing more yet.

It includes a library called Flixel which can be found here: https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel.
